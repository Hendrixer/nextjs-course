## Format
In this course, you'll be following along with me while exploring the concepts of Next.js while building a simple app. We'll stay focused on Next.js specifics and breeze through the rest. All the lessons are on this site. However, to get the best experience, there are videos on [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com) accompanying this course. You will need a membership to view them. (Highly recommended)

Here is the repo, [hendrixer/nextjs-course-app](https://github.com/Hendrixer/nextjs-course-app/tree/master).


Although we'll be building an app from scratch, I'll have every step easily ready for you to look at. Each lesson has a branch name associated with it. You can checkout to that branch to see the solution to that lesson. A lesson on this site will show its branch name like this:

> 🌲 **branch**: `git checkout the-branch-name`

## App
We'll be building a SaaS notes app, ready for funding 😂. Sounds simple, and it is, but allows us to cover everything we need to get the best of Next.js without app complexity getting in the way.

## Legend
